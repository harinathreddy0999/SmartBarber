# Backend Implementation Tasks for SmartBarber App

## Current Status
The app currently uses localStorage for data persistence, which is suitable for prototyping but not for a production application. A proper backend implementation is needed to handle data persistence, authentication, and business logic.

## Required Backend Components

### 1. Authentication System
- Implement JWT-based authentication
- User registration and login endpoints
- Password reset functionality
- Email verification
- Session management

### 2. User Management
- User profile CRUD operations
- Profile picture upload and storage
- User preferences storage

### 3. Booking System
- Appointment scheduling and management
- Real-time availability checking
- Conflict prevention
- Notifications for upcoming appointments
- Cancellation and rescheduling logic

### 4. Barber/Stylist Management
- Stylist profiles and availability
- Specialties and services offered
- Rating and review system
- Portfolio management

### 5. Services Management
- Service catalog with pricing
- Service categories and filtering
- Special offers and promotions

### 6. AI Integration
- Secure API key management for AI services
- Server-side processing of face shape analysis
- Caching of AI results for performance
- Style recommendation algorithm improvements

### 7. Data Storage
- Database design and implementation
- Data migration from localStorage
- Data backup and recovery procedures

### 8. API Development
- RESTful API endpoints for all features
- API documentation
- Rate limiting and security measures

## Technology Recommendations

### Backend Framework Options
- Node.js with Express
- Django (Python)
- Ruby on Rails
- Laravel (PHP)

### Database Options
- PostgreSQL for relational data
- MongoDB for document-based storage
- Redis for caching

### Authentication
- Auth0 or Firebase Authentication for managed auth
- Custom JWT implementation

### File Storage
- AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage for images and files

### Deployment
- Docker containers
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- CI/CD pipeline setup

## Implementation Priority
1. Authentication system
2. Basic user management
3. Booking system core functionality
4. Barber/stylist management
5. Services catalog
6. AI integration
7. Advanced features and optimizations
